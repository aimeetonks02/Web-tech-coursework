                <h2>Scrimba Course</h2>
                <p>Over the summer of 2022, I decided to undergo a course on HTML and CSS from 
                    <a href="https://scrimba.com">Scrimba.com</a>
                     in order
                    to better prepare myself for the Web Technologies module that I knew I had in the first semester
                    of my second year.
                </p>
                <p>This course improved upon the basics that I had learnt during my Introduction to Interaction
                    Design module in my first year. I chose this course in particular so that I could better learn how
                    to make my own websites as it was one of my favourite things I learnt in the past year.
                </p>
                <p>This course has therefore helped me to get a good start on my Web Technologies coursework. This
                    was beneficial as I had a better understanding coming into the module and could wrap my head around
                    the new content easier.

                <h2>GitHub</h2>
                <p>Over the summer, I also worked to set up a GitHub for myself so that I can keep a professional
                    portfolio of all of my university programming. I also hope that by learning GitHub now, I can
                    use it as a skill to stand out from other candidates when applying for future jobs or graduate
                    academies.
                </p>
                <p>GitHub also allows me to keep track of any time I update the code that I am working on, which
                    is beneficial as I am able to go back to previous versions of my code. If something were to break,
                    this would allow me to figure out what I changed that caused the error to occur.

                <h2>Website Development and Improvement</h2>
                <p>In regards to a possible third year project idea, I would like to be able to do something that 
                utilises what I have learnt in both Introduction to Interaction Design and Web Technologies. Possible 
                ideas could be redesigning a website to improve accessibility or to create an online system for a
                business that does not currently have one.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Big Data</h2>
                <p>Another possibility could be to collate some big data and format a wway to present it to the end
                    user so that it is easily understandable. This could be either for a business to check their stocks,
                    or as a service to the general public such as showing best selling products from leading retailers.
